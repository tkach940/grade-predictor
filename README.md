# grade-predictor
Grade Predictor project was a participant at Datathon 2021 at UW-Madison. The application utilizes the data about previous academic performances of the student to predict his grade in current/future classes. For the analysis and prediction part, a multinomial logistic regression was utilized (even though the initial plan was to use a predictive Keras Neural Network). The application stack was created using Flask and MongoDB.
